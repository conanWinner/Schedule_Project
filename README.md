## Introduction

Scheduling classes every semester is often a time-consuming and frustrating task for students â€” typically taking 30 minutes to over an hour. Picking favorite teachers, avoiding time conflicts, balancing subjects per day, and fitting in preferred time slots... itâ€™s a real puzzle.

**Schedule_Project** was built to solve exactly that!  
Just select 7 subjects, and the system will automatically filter 70 relevant classes and generate a personalized, optimized timetable â€” all in seconds.

## Technologies Used

- **LLM (VIT5)**: Analyzes personal preferences such as teachers, time slots, locations, days, and generates initial timetable solutions.
- **NSGA-II**: A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to optimize the timetable under complex constraints and user preferences.
- **LLM-NSGA**: A hybrid model combining LLM and NSGA-II to enhance optimization accuracy and flexibility.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** *(optional)*: Supports LLMs with external data retrieval to enrich and improve schedule generation.

## Objectives

- Automate personalized timetable generation for VKU students.
- Solve a highly-constrained combinatorial optimization problem: preferences for teachers, rooms, days, breaks, subject distribution, etc.
- Deliver a fast, user-friendly web app powered by cutting-edge AI and evolutionary algorithms.
